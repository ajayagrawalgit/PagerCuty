## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Welcome to PagerCuty :sparkles:
Before getting started, please review the following prerequisites to ensure a smooth experience with the tool. 

### Compatibility
PagerCuty can be fully utilized on Linux and MacOS machines. On Windows, while most functionalities work seamlessly, there may be limitations for tasks involving multiline string descriptions. Efforts are being made to enhance OS independence in future updates. If Windows is your preferred choice, the complete potential of PagerCuty can be harnessed through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). 

### Prerequisites for Linux and MacOS Users
For a hassle-free experience with PagerCuty on Linux or MacOS, you'll need the following:

1. **Text Editor**: Ensure that you have the versatile Vi or Vim editor installed. You can install it using your package manager or download it from [vim.org](https://www.vim.org/download.php). üîç

2. **Python Version**: A minimum of Python 3.11.x or a higher version is required for error-free functionality. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). üêç

That's all you need! The remaining dependencies will be automatically installed as Python packages, conveniently listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 

PagerCuty is designed with your needs in mind, and I'm excited to have you on board for this journey üòäüöÄ


<br>

### Installation
To begin using PagerCuty, follow these simple installation steps:

1. Clone the PagerCuty repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajayagrawalgit/PagerCuty.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the PagerCuty folder.
   ```bash
   cd pagercuty
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Make the `pagercuty.py` file executable.
   ```bash
   chmod +x pagercuty.py
   ```

Now you're ready to configure PagerCuty and start managing your PagerDuty incidents.

### Configuration
Before using PagerCuty, you need to configure it with your PagerDuty account details. Open the `config.yaml`  file and find the following lines:

```python
pagerduty:
  api_token:	# Create this from the pagerduty website
  service_id:	# Service IDs which you want to see and manage incidents for (You can find it using this tool itself if you don't know yet)
  email:	# Your Registered E-mail ID with PagerDuty
  script_name: pagercuty
  time_interval: 30	# This is the time interval at which the auto acknowledge function works. The unit is in seconds. (Default is set to 30 seconds)
  company_pd_url:	# Here, you have to put the the url which your comapny uses to login to pagerduty. Example: https://ajayagrawal.pagerduty.com/sign_in/
  company_domain:	# Here, you have to put the the url which your comapny uses to login to pagerduty. Example: https://ajayagrawal.pagerduty.com (Make sure there's no '/' at the end here)
```
